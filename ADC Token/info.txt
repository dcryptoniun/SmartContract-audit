Code Audit Report
The contract code is a standard implementation of the ERC-20 token. The contract is implemented in Solidity version 0.8.4.

Security
The code is written using the OpenZeppelin library that provides well-audited, battle-tested security implementations for various functionalities.

The contract uses SafeMath to prevent overflow and underflow vulnerabilities. Also, the transferFrom function implements a check to ensure that the spender has the allowance to spend the tokens.

Style
The code follows the standardized Solidity naming conventions for functions and variables.

The code also includes inline comments, which help understand the code.

Gas Optimization
The contract uses using to minimize gas consumption for the SafeMath library.

Recommendations
There are no critical issues found in the code, and the implementation is satisfactory. However, some improvements could be made for readability and optimization.

It would be better to add more inline comments to explain the code's working and functions' purpose.
The version variable is unused, and it could be removed.
It would be better to include the version of the ERC-20 interface that is being implemented, for clarity purposes.
Overall, the code is secure and follows the standard conventions. It can be deployed safely.
